# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL_TASK 3

**COMPANY** : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME** : SURENDERAN R

**INTERN ID** : CT08DZZ

**DOMAIN** : MACHINE LEARNING

**BATCH DURATION** : DECEMBER 17th,2024 to JANUARY 17th,2025

## Project Overview
In this project, we:

- Load and preprocess an image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10).
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.
- Visualize the training and validation performance (accuracy and loss curves).
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- tensorflow or torch (for PyTorch)
- matplotlib (for visualizations)
- numpy (for array manipulations)
- seaborn (for advanced plotting)

## Dataset
The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular image classification dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
You can replace CIFAR-10 with any other image dataset by updating the data loading part of the code.

## Code Structure
- cnn_image_classification.py: The main Python script containing the model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization.
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- notebooks/: (Optional) If using Jupyter Notebooks, this directory may contain notebooks for exploration.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement an Image Classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow (or PyTorch). The model classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and visualized through plots.
